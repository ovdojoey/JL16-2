In 2013, Promo Only was using outdated billing software and had no way to effectively process online orders.
 I was tasked with building a new online based system to replace outdated in-house ordering tools.
Using PHP and the Paypal API, I developed a new system for our sales reps to process orders. These tools would later be migrated to the PromoOnly.com website.

    POM was built with PHP, Paypal API, postgreSQL, mySQL, jQuery, HTML, and Less.
